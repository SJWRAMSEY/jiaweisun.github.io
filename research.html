<td align="left"><p>Simulating atmospheric turbulence is an essential task for evaluating
turbulence mitigation algorithms and training learning-based methods.
Advanced numerical simulators for atmospheric turbulence are available, but
they require evaluating wave propagation which is computationally expensive.
In this paper, we present a propagation-free method for simulating imaging
through turbulence. The key idea behind our work is a new method to draw
inter-modal and spatially correlated Zernike coefficients. By establishing
the equivalence between the angle-of-arrival correlation by Basu, McCrae and
Fiorino (2015) and the multi-aperture correlation by Chanan (1992), we show
that the Zernike coefficients can be drawn according to a covariance matrix
defining the correlations. We propose fast and scalable sampling strategies
to draw these samples. The new method allows us to compress the wave
propagation problem into a sampling problem, hence making the new simulator
significantly faster than existing ones. Experimental results show that the
simulator has an excellent match with the theory and real turbulence data. </p>

<h2>Physics-Inspired Reconstruction Algorithm</h2>

<td align="left"><p>Ground based long-range passive imaging systems often suffer from degraded
image quality due to a turbulent atmosphere. While methods exist for removing
such turbulent distortions, many are limited to static sequences which cannot
be extended to dynamic scenes. In addition, the physics of the turbulence is
often not integrated into the image reconstruction algorithm. In this paper,
we present a unified method for atmospheric turbulence mitigation in both
static and dynamic sequences. We are able to achieve better results compared
to existing methods by utilizing (i) a novel space-time non-local averaging
method to construct a reliable reference frame, (ii) a geometric consistency
and a sharpness metric to generate the lucky frame, (iii) a
physics-constrained prior model of the point spread function for blind
deconvolution. Experimental results based on synthetic and real long-range
turbulence sequences validate the performance of the proposed method. </p>
